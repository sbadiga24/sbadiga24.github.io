  <h2><b>Academic and Robotics Pursuits</b></h2>
  <br>
    <p style="font-size: 18px">
    I am currently living out my dream as a student at ,<a href="https://robotics.asu.edu/"> ASU Robotics @ ASU</a>,  right at the heart of innovation. 
    <br>My goal? To revolutionize robot capabilities in challenging environments, emphasizing perception, Machine Learning, and Aerial Robotics. I thrive on understanding and applying the convergence of automation and AI to real-world challenges, always keeping an eye on the bigger picture.
    </p>
  <br>

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
    I earned my degree in Electronic and communication from <a href="https://www.kluniversity.in/">KL Deemed to Be University</a>. Alongside my team and under the guidance of the R&N Dean, <a href="link-to-professor-profile">Prof. Subba Rao</a>, I garnered recognition for conceptualizing and developing an autonomous delivery mobile robot prototype. This project leveraged advanced technologies such as ROS, state estimation, sensor fusion, and real-time control algorithms. My dedication to pushing technological boundaries was evident in this endeavor.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size: 20px" id="achievements"><b>Robotic Achievements</b></h2>
  <br>

  <p style="font-size: 18px">
  Under my leadership, our team won the following awards in mobile robotics competitions:
    <ul>
    <li>Gold medal in the 2018 state level competition conducted by <a href="https://apssdc.gov.in/">Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC)</a>.</li>
    <li>Gold medal in the 2018 regional level competition conducted by <a href="https://nsdcindia.org/">National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC)</a>.</li>
    <li>Silver medal in the 2018 national level competition conducted by <a href="https://nsdcindia.org/">National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC)</a>.</li>
    <li>Gold medal in the 2020 state level competition conducted by <a href="https://apssdc.gov.in/">Andhra Pradesh Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC)</a>.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2><b>My Unique Qualities</b></h2><br>

<p style="font-size: 18px">
    <u><b>Perseverance</b></u>: My journey began with a stumble, failing the JEE mains exam. However, my unwavering spirit led me to eventually gain admission into my dream institute, KLU. This same perseverance carried me through challenges in robotics competitions, internships, and research endeavors, molding me into a relentless innovator and problem-solver.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px">
    <u><b>Inquisitiveness</b></u>: I'm driven by a genuine curiosity, always keen to understand the intricate technology behind everyday gadgets.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px">
    <u><b>Innovative Approach</b></u>: While working with R.O.S., I've found that Visual Studio Code offers advantages over traditional terminal-based editing in a Docker environment. Its speed and the plethora of available plugins enable me to efficiently set up an environment, craft a URDF file for a robot, and develop C++ plugins, optimizing my workflow.
</p>

  <br>

<h4 style="font-size: 20px">My Philosophy: Passionately Navigating Complex Challenges</h4><br>

<p style="font-size: 18px">
Leveraging the <a href="#distinguishesme">distinctive skills and qualities</a> I've honed over time, I face intricate challenges head-on, always focusing on the core essence of an issue. I'm fervently drawn to the realms of machine learning and perception within robotics. From creating game-changing code for premier robotics competitions to impactful contributions in open-source platforms, my software expertise is both multifaceted and ever-evolving, enriched by a myriad of professional ventures.
</p><br>

<p style="font-size: 18px">
Beyond my technical pursuits, I am deeply moved by the artistry and prowess of performers across various domains. The adrenaline-pumping moments from the final fight in "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvLl2S2qH1E">Real Steel</a>" particularly resonate with me, showcasing a blend of emotion, technology, and human spirit.
