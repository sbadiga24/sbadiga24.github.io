  description: <br>I played a pivotal role in software tool development, creating a robust solution to manage over 2,000 parameters for various drone models. This streamlined our engineering workflows and led to enhanced drone performance. Additionally, I tackled critical issues in the Ground Control Station, including custom command functionality, resulting in more efficient production processes and safer flights. I also conducted extensive testing to ensure the seamless management of multiple UAVs in large-scale operations. Furthermore, I contributed to drone firmware development, where I improved the path planning algorithm using the Dijkstra Path-Planner, achieving a remarkable 95% optimization rate and greatly enhancing drone navigation in complex terrains.
