# Aeromodelling
## Overview
**Aeromodelling** is a captivating blend of art, science, and engineering, centered on the design, construction, and flight of **model aircraft**. Historically a testing ground for aviation pioneers, it now stands as a popular hobby for enthusiasts worldwide. It offers a hands-on understanding of principles like aerodynamics, **control, and propulsion**. As technology advances, modern model aircraft incorporate advanced materials,**electronic systems**, and even autonomous flight capabilities, making aeromodelling a testament to humankind's enduring fascination with flight.

## **Designing RC Delta - Gazebo**
In the realm of aeromodelling, designing an RC Delta plane is a blend of aesthetics and functionality. The Delta configuration, characterized by its triangular or wing-shaped design, offers agility, speed, and stability, especially at high altitudes. While its unique shape reduces wingtip vortices, enhancing aerodynamic efficiency, it also demands careful placement of control surfaces. Modern RC Delta planes often incorporate advanced materials for lightweight yet robust construction. By balancing these design aspects with considerations for propulsion, control systems, and electronics, enthusiasts can craft an RC Delta plane tailored for both performance and maneuverability.
