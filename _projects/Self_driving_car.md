# Self-Driving Car Simulation in JavaScript

## **Project Description:**
This project aims to create a fully interactive self-driving car simulation using JavaScript, focusing on the implementation of neural networks for autonomous driving decision-making. By simulating road environments, traffic conditions, and artificial sensors, this simulation provides a detailed insight into the workings of autonomous vehicles. The project covers a wide array of components, from basic road definitions to advanced neural network integration, offering a deep dive into the challenges and solutions in developing self-driving car technologies.

## **Road Definition:**
The simulation starts with a detailed road layout that includes lanes, curves, intersections, and traffic signs, providing a realistic environment for the self-driving car to navigate.

## **Artificial Sensors:**
We equip the self-driving car with simulated sensors, mimicking real-world devices like LiDAR and cameras, to gather data about its surroundings and make informed navigation decisions.

## **Collision Detection:**
Ensuring safety, our collision detection system allows the car to identify and avoid obstacles, crucial for both the simulation's realism and the autonomous vehicle's operational integrity.

## **Traffic Simulation:**
A dynamic traffic simulation introduces other vehicles on the road, each behaving according to realistic driving patterns, adding complexity and requiring sophisticated decision-making from the self-driving car.

## **Neural Network:**
At the core of the simulation is a neural network that processes input from the car's sensors to make driving decisions. This network learns from various driving scenarios, continuously improving its performance.
